Feynman stores all configuration and state under `~/.feynman/`. This directory is created on first run and contains settings, authentication tokens, session history, and installed packages.

## Directory structure

```
~/.feynman/
├── settings.json       # Core configuration
├── web-search.json     # Web search routing config
├── auth/               # OAuth tokens and API keys
├── sessions/           # Persisted conversation history
└── packages/           # Installed optional packages
```

The `settings.json` file is the primary configuration file. It is created by `feynman setup` and can be edited manually. A typical configuration looks like:

```json
{
  "defaultProvider": "openai",
  "defaultModel": "<non-pro-model-id-from-model-list>",
  "defaultThinkingLevel": "medium"
}
```

## Model configuration

The `defaultProvider` and `defaultModel` fields set which model is used when you launch Feynman without the `--model` flag. You can change them via the CLI:

```bash
feynman model list
feynman model set <provider>/<non-pro-model-id>
```

To see all models you have configured:

```bash
feynman model list
```

Only authenticated/configured providers appear in `feynman model list`. If you only see OpenAI models, it usually means only OpenAI auth is configured so far.

To add another provider, authenticate it first:

```bash
feynman model login anthropic
feynman model login google
feynman model login amazon-bedrock
```

Then switch the default model:

```bash
feynman model list
feynman model set <provider>/<non-pro-model-id>
```

The `model set` command accepts both `provider/model` and `provider:model` formats. Feynman rejects Pro-class model IDs here and in `--model`; choose a non-Pro model for defaults and per-session overrides. `feynman model login google` opens the API-key flow directly, while `feynman model login amazon-bedrock` verifies the AWS credential chain that Pi uses for Bedrock access.

## Web search configuration

Research workflows use `~/.feynman/web-search.json` for web-search routing. The default `auto` route uses API-backed providers only: Exa, then Perplexity, then Gemini API. It does not read Chromium or Chrome cookies, so it should not trigger a macOS Keychain prompt.

Example:

```json
{
  "provider": "auto",
  "searchProvider": "auto",
  "exaApiKey": "exa_...",
  "perplexityApiKey": "pplx-...",
  "geminiApiKey": "AIza..."
}
```

Gemini Web browser-cookie access is disabled by default. To opt into it, set `"geminiBrowser": true` in `web-search.json`; API-backed search is recommended for `/deepresearch`.

## Subagent model overrides

Feynman's bundled subagents inherit the main non-Pro default model unless you override them explicitly. Inside the REPL, run:

```bash
/feynman-model
```

This opens an interactive picker where you can either:

- change the main non-Pro default model for the session environment
- assign a different non-Pro model to a specific bundled subagent such as `researcher`, `reviewer`, `writer`, or `verifier`

Per-subagent overrides are persisted in the synced agent files under `~/.feynman/agent/agents/` with a `model:` frontmatter field. Removing that field makes the subagent inherit the main non-Pro default model again.

## Thinking levels

The `thinkingLevel` field controls how much reasoning the model does before responding. Available levels are `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `xhigh`. Higher levels produce more thorough analysis at the cost of latency and token usage. You can override per-session:

```bash
feynman --thinking high
```

## Environment variables

Feynman respects the following environment variables, which take precedence over `settings.json`:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `FEYNMAN_MODEL` | Override the default model with a non-Pro model |
| `FEYNMAN_HOME` | Override the config directory (default: `~/.feynman`) |
| `FEYNMAN_THINKING` | Override the thinking level |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic API key |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google Gemini API key |
| `AWS_PROFILE` | Preferred AWS profile for Amazon Bedrock |
| `TAVILY_API_KEY` | Tavily web search API key |
| `SERPER_API_KEY` | Serper web search API key |
| `FEYNMAN_TELEMETRY` | Set to `off` to disable Feynman analytics, logs, and traces |
| `FEYNMAN_POSTHOG_HOST` | Override the PostHog ingest host |
| `FEYNMAN_POSTHOG_PROJECT_ID` | Override the PostHog project ID used in telemetry metadata |
| `FEYNMAN_POSTHOG_KEY` | Override the PostHog project token |
| `PI_OTEL_CAPTURE_CONTENT` | Controls Pi runtime span content capture. Feynman defaults this to `metadata_only` |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` | Pi runtime trace endpoint. Feynman sets this to PostHog AI Observability by default |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_ENDPOINT` | Feynman CLI log endpoint. Feynman sets this to PostHog Logs by default |

## Observability

Feynman sends three bounded telemetry streams to the configured PostHog project when telemetry is enabled:

- product analytics events from the CLI through the PostHog SDK
- CLI logs through PostHog Logs at `/i/v1/logs`
- OpenTelemetry spans for the CLI and Pi runtime

The CLI's generic spans use PostHog distributed tracing at `/i/v1/traces`; query them in HogQL from `posthog.trace_spans`. The Pi runtime's LLM/tool spans use PostHog AI Observability at `/i/v0/ai/otel`; inspect them in the AI Observability traces UI or query their metadata as `$ai_*` events in `events`. Large AI properties live in `posthog.ai_events` during PostHog's AI-event retention window. Do not query bare `traces`, `spans`, or `trace_spans` table names; PostHog registers distributed trace spans as `posthog.trace_spans`.

Feynman sets `PI_OTEL_CAPTURE_CONTENT=metadata_only`, so Pi spans carry model, tool, timing, count, and status metadata without prompt text or tool payload bodies. Set `FEYNMAN_TELEMETRY=off` to disable analytics, logs, and traces; Feynman also clears inherited OTLP/PostHog environment variables before launching Pi in that mode.

## Session storage

Each conversation is persisted as a JSON file in `~/.feynman/sessions/`. To start a fresh session:

```bash
feynman --new-session
```

To point sessions at a different directory (useful for per-project session isolation):

```bash
feynman --session-dir ~/myproject/.feynman/sessions
```

## Diagnostics

Run `feynman doctor` to verify your configuration is valid, check authentication status for all configured providers, and detect missing optional dependencies. The doctor command outputs a checklist showing what is working and what needs attention.
