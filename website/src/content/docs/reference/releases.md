## Unreleased

### Science Workbench

- Expanded `feynman serve` into a standalone open-science workbench surface with Feynman-owned project/session/frame state, project metadata, Pi chat, frame message rows, frame backfill health records, Feynman Bio Tools, notebooks, compute inventory, artifacts, lineage, provenance, settings, memory categories, onboarding intent context, and redacted credential availability ledgers.
- Added a Feynman-owned `~/.feynman/active-org.json` and `~/.feynman/orgs/<org_uuid>/` app spine so the local workbench has an org-scoped home structure instead of a flat scratch directory.
- Added a Feynman-owned org database at `~/.feynman/orgs/<org_uuid>/feynman-workbench.db`, refreshed from the local workbench state with reference-shaped project, frame, message, artifact, artifact-version, execution, verification, memory, note, annotation, read-cursor, artifact-folder, compute-provider, MCP-grant, memory-category, routine-schedule, managed-endpoint, and capability-setting tables.
- Added compact table envelopes in that database for the remaining reference-shaped workbench ledgers Feynman already owns in state, including agents, skills, credentials, OAuth tokens, events, notifications, session activity, claims, host logs, marketplace rows, and archive rows.
- Compute-provider rows in the org database now persist egress policy and Modal environment fields, including in-place upgrades for existing local databases. Split science connector attachments, split MCP grants, and custom MCP resource identifiers are mirrored through Feynman's owned ledger rows.
- Added a Feynman-owned chemistry sketcher tool that creates editable KET, Molfile, RXN, or SMILES artifacts under `outputs/chemistry-sketches/` for the local Ketcher editor, instead of requiring a reference-app MCP runtime.
- KET, RXN, CDXML, and CXSMILES chemistry artifacts now open as first-class molecule previews in the workbench. Feynman marks these scanner formats as previewable text artifacts, shows lightweight chemistry metadata, routes sketch files into the local Ketcher editor, and avoids trying to render Ketcher-only formats through RDKit.
- Moved app-owned workbench state into `~/.feynman/orgs/<org_uuid>/workbench/workspaces/<workspace-id>/`, including workbench settings, chat sessions, uploads, memory, annotations, OAuth token references, notebook logs, Modal job scripts, managed Python/R environments, artifact snapshots, and cloud-export audit logs. Existing home-level `~/.feynman/workbench` records and checkout-local `.feynman/workbench` records are copied forward on first access.
- Added Feynman-owned credential and setup-intent state so the workbench can show which research capabilities are available without exposing raw secrets or requiring another local app at runtime.
- Added Feynman-owned skill source and license-assent ledgers so the workbench can audit its bundled science skill pack without depending on an external marketplace service.
- Added Feynman-owned watch routine ledgers so `/watch` plans and baselines appear as honest scheduled or blocked routine state in the workbench.
- Added Feynman-owned contact-email and credential-ask decision ledgers so public database contact consent and provider credential readiness are auditable without exposing raw credential values.
- Added Feynman-owned compute poller lease rows so active compute jobs and pending terminations expose the same single-writer polling guard shape as the science workbench control plane.
- Added Feynman-owned review feedback rows so user-requested reviewer passes are auditable by frame, type, model, response id, and bounded context snapshot.
- Added Feynman-owned frame rows so projects, chat sessions, artifact runs, and upload areas expose a first-class control-plane frame spine through local state.
- Added Feynman-owned project metadata rows with local owner, created/updated timestamps, context, memory state, and upload-frame linkage.
- Added Feynman-owned frame message rows so persisted chat turns are auditable by frame id, message index, UUID, role, status, and structured message JSON.
- Added Feynman-owned frame backfill health records so failed historical frame imports can be tracked without inventing failures in clean workspaces.
- Chat-produced artifacts now attach to the producing session and project by snapshot/output provenance, so Run and Project file scopes, header metrics, artifact folders, versions, and verification evidence agree even when the file slug differs from the chat frame id.
- Files now show a host selector for local workspace artifacts, SSH/BYOC compute hosts, and cloud buckets derived from Feynman's owned compute and credential state.
- HTML report previews now support element-level annotation inside the sandboxed iframe, including selector/text capture, saved badges, and the same artifact annotation/refinement path used by text, image, and PDF anchors.
- Artifact Notes now open in workbench modals with target context, existing note count, add/edit/delete controls, Cmd/Ctrl+Enter save, note preview, and Open artifact navigation, backed by Feynman's owned target-note ledger.
- Cloud storage now opens a workbench modal from Customize > Storage, showing credential-backed S3/GCS/Azure/local targets, configured or missing status, target details, connection-reference feedback, delete, and a Credentials navigation action.
- Artifact Cloud export now opens a workbench modal that shows configured and missing storage targets, lets users choose the destination path, and records exports through Feynman's owned cloud-export audit log.
- Expanded Feynman Bio Tools with no-login KEGG `link:` and `conv:` modes for batched pathway/reaction/database cross-links and outside ID conversions, including missing-ID reporting and endpoint provenance.
- Expanded Feynman Bio Tools with no-login PanglaoDB support for curated single-cell marker genes by cell type or gene symbol, including canonical-marker filters, organ/species context, nicknames, and sensitivity/specificity scores.

### Website and Docs

- Added the Science Workbench guide, homepage workbench section, command-reference entry, setup notes, and README wording for the standalone workbench path.
- Corrected the npm install Node.js range in the website docs to match the package engine range.

## v0.3.5 - 2026-06-28

### Pi Runtime

- Refreshed the bundled Pi runtime packages to `0.80.2`, restoring the `@earendil-works/pi-ai/compat` entrypoint and extension-loader aliases used by optional packages such as `pi-web-access` (#183).
- Feynman's package installer now derives legacy `@mariozechner/*` alias versions from the current canonical `@earendil-works/*` runtime packages first, so stale legacy package roots cannot seed old Pi peer versions during `feynman update`.
- Updated the Pi TUI patcher for the current upstream overflow-check layout so overwide rendered lines are clipped instead of crashing the session renderer.

### Validation

- Added regressions for the current Pi TUI overflow block, release-note compat coverage, and legacy Pi alias derivation from current runtime metadata.

## v0.3.4 - 2026-06-12

### Research

- Added `feynman paper <id-or-title>` for single-paper access resolution across OpenAlex, DOI, arXiv/alphaXiv, and Europe PMC, with optional source-specific text fetching and bounded artifacts that omit raw full-text bodies.
- Added `feynman rank <topic>` with PaperRank scoring for read-first triage, transparent citation/method/reproducibility evidence, graph context, optional critique or model synthesis, bounded JSONL outputs, and provenance.
- Added `--reproduction-notes` so completed reproduction outcomes are recorded separately from planned replication checks. When reproduction notes are supplied, PaperRank writes the reproduction ledger, notes template, and replication plan; ordinary read-first runs keep those extra artifacts out of the default output.

### Model Catalog

- Fixed research model selection so recommended/default model paths, stale settings, model lists, and explicit CLI overrides reject Pro-class model IDs and keep OpenAI-only installs on the newest available non-Pro GPT model exposed by Pi.
- Added PaperRank model-selection provenance so CLI output, JSON output, generated synthesis Markdown, and rank provenance name the actual synthesis model and whether it came from the recommendation path or an explicit override.
- Updated setup/configuration examples and the LiteLLM fallback prompt to avoid GPT-4-era and premium-tier defaults.

### Pi Runtime

- Refreshed the bundled Pi runtime packages to `0.79.10` and updated production dependency overrides so `npm audit --omit=dev` is clean after the refresh. This inherits Pi's compaction-event context, exact-version update flow, nested-repo `find` fix, and OpenAI-compatible `reasoning_details` streaming fix.
- Fixed session rename crashes when long slash-workflow names overflowed the custom header. Header workflow names are now clipped to their column in both wide and narrow layouts before descriptions are rendered.
- Removed the old `generative-ui`, `ui`, and `all-extras` optional package/update targets. Optional packages now stay one-by-one and research-continuity focused.

## v0.2.58 - 2026-05-16

### Optional Packages

- Added a `hindsight` optional preset that installs `@luxusai/pi-hindsight`, giving users a first-class path to Hindsight-backed research-continuity memory without adding it to the default install.
- Added `hindsight` and `pi-hindsight` update aliases so `feynman update hindsight` resolves to the same package source.
- Updated the package-stack and setup docs to show Hindsight as an optional memory surface and note that it requires a Hindsight server or Hindsight Cloud account.

### Validation

- Added regression coverage for the new optional preset, research-continuity package copy, removed bulk/UI presets, and update aliases.

## v0.2.57 - 2026-05-15

### Runtime Reliability

- Fixed the interactive prompt input color on macOS/iTerm profiles where typed text inherited a black terminal foreground against Feynman's dark editor background.
- Applied the editor foreground/background patch through the shared Pi patch module so package-local installs and the vendored runtime archive stay in sync.

### Validation

- Added regression coverage for the patched Pi editor/theme source transformations, including idempotency.

## v0.2.56 - 2026-05-13

### Security

- Updated the `protobufjs` dependency override from `7.5.5` to `7.5.8`, which pulls in the patched `@protobufjs/utf8` release and clears the current production audit advisory set.

### Validation

- Re-ran the root production audit after the override refresh and confirmed it reports zero vulnerabilities.

## v0.2.55 - 2026-05-13

### Model Catalog

- Updated Feynman's research model preference order so the newest available non-Pro OpenAI GPT model can be recommended, auto-selected, and surfaced ahead of older OpenAI GPT models.
- Applied the same newest-available non-Pro GPT preference to OpenAI Codex when Pi exposes Codex directly.
- Updated first-run/default setup preferences so OpenAI-only installs choose the newest available non-Pro OpenAI GPT model when available.

### Validation

- Added regression coverage for newest-available non-Pro OpenAI recommendation, model sorting, and default setup seeding.

## v0.2.54 - 2026-05-11

### Runtime Reliability

- Fixed packed npm installs that hoist package dependencies outside Feynman's package root. Feynman now falls back to its vendored `.feynman/npm` runtime workspace when resolving Pi, so `feynman doctor` and prompt launches work from a clean packed install.
- Applied runtime node-module patches to both package-local dependencies and the vendored runtime workspace.

### Validation

- Added regression coverage for packed-install Pi path resolution and vendored runtime patching.
- Added an isolated packed-install E2E that installs the generated tarball into a clean prefix/home and launches Feynman from that install.

## v0.2.53 - 2026-05-11

### Runtime Reliability

- Hardened alphaXiv search fallback again: if both the removed MCP search tools and `discover_papers` are unavailable, `alpha search` now falls back to the public alphaXiv fast REST search endpoint.
- Patched the Pi extension loader to alias both `@mariozechner/*` and `@earendil-works/*` Pi runtime imports to Feynman's already initialized bundled runtime, preventing mixed-namespace TUI/theme crashes when expanding tool output.
- Applied the extension-loader patch to the vendored runtime archive path, not only the local development `node_modules` path.

### Validation

- Added regression coverage for upgrading the old `discover_papers`-only alphaXiv patch and for dual-namespace Pi runtime aliasing.

## v0.2.52 - 2026-05-09

### Runtime Reliability

- Seed bundled runtime packages before package updates so missing undeclared extension dependencies such as `typebox` are repaired before extension load.
- Include Pi's `typebox` runtime package beside installed Pi packages when Feynman has to run npm directly.
- Include the new `@earendil-works/*` Pi runtime package namespace beside the legacy `@mariozechner/*` namespace so updated Pi extensions such as `pi-btw` and `pi-markdown-preview` can load.
- Patched alphaXiv search in the bundled alpha-hub runtime to fall back to the newer `discover_papers` MCP tool when alphaXiv no longer exposes the older search tool names.
- Hardened model tool-call handling for common alias mistakes: `search_web` now maps to `web_search`, and bare `fetch` / `WebFetch` / `read_url_content` map to `fetch_content` with array URLs normalized.
- Fixed the Windows docker probe in the research header so `cmd.exe` no longer emits localized mojibake from Unix-only `/dev/null` redirection.

### Workflow Prompts

- Added a shared tool-discipline block to every workflow prompt so lead agents see canonical tool names before workflow-specific instructions.

### Validation

- Added regression coverage for alphaXiv search fallback, Pi tool alias normalization, bundled runtime dependency installs, and prompt tool discipline.

## v0.2.51 - 2026-05-09

### Package Manager

- Hardened Pi package installs and updates so peer-only Pi runtime packages are materialized into Feynman's npm prefix beside installed Pi packages.
- This prevents optional or legacy Pi packages from failing at extension load time when they import Pi runtime modules that npm did not install because Feynman uses legacy peer dependency mode.

### Validation

- Added package-manager coverage for installing Pi runtime peers beside Pi npm packages.

## v0.2.50 - 2026-05-09

### Skills Installer

- Added an explicit Codex skills target for standalone skill installs: `--codex` on macOS/Linux and `-Scope Codex` on Windows.
- Kept the existing default/user install behavior compatible while documenting the Codex, repo-local Claude/agent, and OpenCode target paths.

### Validation

- Added installer coverage for the Codex target and target-specific docs.

## v0.2.49 - 2026-05-07

### Website

- Updated the website build stack to patched Astro 6/Vite 7.
- Migrated docs content collections to Astro's current content-layer config.

### Validation

- Website build, typecheck, lint, and production audit passed.
- Root build, typecheck, full tests, package dry-run, native bundle build, and production audit passed after the website upgrade.

## v0.2.48 - 2026-05-07

### Fixes

- Restored Node.js 24 support for the Feynman CLI and npm package.
- Slimmed the default Pi package set to the core AI research essentials: alphaXiv access, subagents, document parsing, and web access.
- Moved memory and session search out of the default install path so optional package failures cannot block first launch.
- Kept session search gated to Node.js 22.x because its upstream sqlite dependency still depends on native prebuild coverage.
- Upgraded the TypeScript toolchain to 6.0 and updated the build config for its explicit `rootDir` requirement.

### Documentation

- Updated package-stack, setup, install, and session-search docs to distinguish core researcher packages from optional extras.

### Validation

- Full local tests passed: 157/157.
- Typecheck, root build, website build, native bundle build, production `npm audit --omit=dev`, and package dry-run passed.
- Package dry-run verified the bundled runtime workspace excludes memory and session search by default.

## v0.2.47 - 2026-05-07

### Documentation

- Clarified that Feynman's package, extension, and skill wiring follows Pi's upstream package model.
- Linked the Hugging Face Hub API and environment-variable docs from the README and website docs.
- Clarified that Hugging Face file reads refuse obvious model weights, archives, and dataset shards before download.

### Validation

- Tightened the Hugging Face binary-file refusal regression test.
- Full local tests passed: 157/157.
- Typecheck, root build, website build, and production `npm audit --omit=dev` passed.

## v0.2.46 - 2026-05-07

### Updates

- Added the `/recipe` workflow for ranked ML training recipes backed by papers, datasets, docs, implementation paths, and verification status.
- Added read-only Hugging Face Hub inspection tools for dataset metadata, repo file listing, and small text file reads. These support recipe and replication grounding without requiring Hub write access, and refuse obvious weight/archive/shard reads before download.
- Updated `/replicate` so ML-heavy targets perform a recipe extraction pass before execution planning.

### Documentation

- Added website docs for the `/recipe` workflow and Hugging Face Hub tools.
- Updated README, quickstart, command references, agent docs, replication docs, and package-stack docs for the new workflow and tools.

### Validation

- Added unit coverage for Hugging Face tool registration, endpoint formatting, auth headers, file listing limits, truncation, and binary-file refusal.
- Full local tests passed: 157/157.
- Typecheck, root build, website build, CLI help, and live Hugging Face endpoint smoke checks passed.

## v0.2.45 - 2026-05-07

### Updates

- Updated the bundled Pi runtime packages to `@mariozechner/pi-ai@0.73.0` and `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent@0.73.0`.
- Updated `@clack/prompts` to `1.3.0` for the setup/onboarding prompt surface.

### Validation

- Full local tests passed: 154/154.
- Typecheck, root build, website build, `feynman doctor`, and production `npm audit --omit=dev` passed.
- JSONL RPC smoke passed with `get_state` and a `bash` command returning `FEYNMAN_RPC_OK`.
- Release CI published npm `0.2.45`, built all native bundles, and created the GitHub release.

## v0.2.44 - 2026-05-06

### Fixes

- Updated transitive dependency override pins to patched versions so production `npm audit` reports zero vulnerabilities.
- This removes advisories in `basic-ftp`, `fast-xml-parser`, `hono`, and `ip-address` while keeping the dependency changes scoped to existing transitive packages.

### Validation

- Production `npm audit --omit=dev` passed with zero vulnerabilities.
- Full local tests passed: 154/154.
- Typecheck, root build, website build, and `feynman doctor` passed.

## v0.2.43 - 2026-05-06

### Fixes

- Restricted `.feynman/web-search.json` permissions to user-only (`0600`) after Feynman writes web-search provider configuration.
- This protects stored web-search API keys such as Exa, Perplexity, and Gemini keys from permissive local umasks.

### Validation

- Added POSIX regression coverage for saved web-search config permissions.
- Full local tests passed: 154/154.
- Typecheck and build passed.

## v0.2.42 - 2026-05-06

### Fixes

- Fixed runtime RPC startup in projects with `.feynman/settings.json` package entries by patching Pi's project npm install path to use peer-dependency-compatible installs.
- This prevents project-scoped package sync from failing on packages such as `@aliou/pi-processes` before the RPC session can start.

### Validation

- Added regression coverage for the embedded Pi package-manager patch.
- Real `v0.2.41` release RPC testing reproduced the missing project-package install failure that this release fixes.

## v0.2.41 - 2026-05-06

### Fixes

- Fixed startup package seeding so copied bundled packages are treated as satisfied instead of falling through to repeated global npm installs.
- Seeded bundled packages before interactive setup reports missing packages, avoiding unnecessary first-run package prompts when the standalone bundle already has the runtime workspace.
- Restricted supported Node.js runtimes to Node 20.19.x through Node 22.x because sqlite-backed Pi packages such as session search are not reliable under Node 24.
- Updated release CI to build, test, publish, and package native bundles with Node 22.

### Documentation

- Added research-only biomedical literature review guidance with PICO/PICOS framing, evidence-type separation, privacy boundaries, and non-clinical-advice wording.
- Updated npm install docs to show the new supported Node engine range.

### Validation

- Full local tests passed: 151/151.
- Typecheck and root build passed.

## v0.2.40 - 2026-04-19

### Fixes

- Fixed local-model web-search failures where a model calls non-existent search aliases such as `google:search`; Feynman now maps those aliases to Pi's real `web_search` tool when it is available.
- Granted the bundled researcher and verifier agents access to Pi web-access tools (`web_search`, `fetch_content`, and `get_search_content`) so their prompts and allowed tools match.
- Made `feynman doctor` and `feynman search status` explicitly show when `web-search.json` has not been created and how to initialize it.
- Stopped treating expired OAuth credentials as authenticated model availability, so `doctor`, `model list`, and onboarding guide users to re-login instead of failing later in chat.
- Added a package-workspace setup lock so concurrent Feynman invocations do not race while restoring `.feynman/npm`.

### Validation

- Full local tests passed: 137/137.
- Typecheck, build, vendored runtime regeneration, runtime archive inspection, sequential CLI smoke, and parallel CLI smoke passed.

## v0.2.39 - 2026-04-19

### Fixes

- Fixed TUI-selected thinking/reasoning effort persistence. Feynman no longer passes an implicit `--thinking medium` on every launch, so thinking levels saved by Pi after `Shift+Tab` survive restarts.
- Explicit `--thinking <level>` and `FEYNMAN_THINKING=<level>` still override the saved default for that launch.

### Validation

- Added regression coverage that Feynman only passes a launch thinking override when it was explicitly configured.
- Full local tests passed: 126/126.
- Typecheck and build passed.

## v0.2.38 - 2026-04-19

### Fixes

- Fixed `feynman update memory` and `feynman update session-search` so friendly core-package aliases resolve to the correct npm package sources and use Feynman's npm install path with peer-dependency compatibility flags.
- Fixed `feynman summarize ... --window-size ...` and related summarize tuning flags when the flags appear after the source positional.
- Fixed `feynman setup preview` so it actually runs the preview dependency check, matching the legacy `--setup-preview` alias.
- Made optional `generative-ui` install/update failures degrade cleanly on macOS toolchains where upstream `glimpseui` cannot compile, without dumping thousands of Swift compiler lines.
- Reduced deepresearch TUI redraw churn by freezing the Feynman header's Last Activity snapshot during live streaming work instead of recomputing it every render.
- Fixed bundled skills that referenced prompt templates through broken installed relative paths.
- Fixed the embedded Pi patcher so repeated runtime preparation does not duplicate the TUI stdin error handler.

### Documentation

- Documented `feynman setup preview`.
- Documented the existing `Shift+Tab` thinking-level hotkey and `/hotkeys` discovery path.

### Validation

- Full local tests passed: 124/124.
- Typecheck, build, and clean website build passed.
- Local CLI matrix passed for help, doctor, status, model list/tier, search status/set, alpha status, setup preview, packages list/install, and package update aliases.
- End-to-end workflow runs completed for chat, summarize, review, compare, audit, draft, lit, deepresearch with confirmation, replicate, watch/jobs, log, and a bounded autoresearch loop.

## v0.2.37 - 2026-04-19

### Fixes

- Hardened `/deepresearch` reviewer/audit fix handling so Feynman may only claim a patch landed after the edit/write tool succeeds and an explicit on-disk check proves the old unsupported content is gone and the corrected content exists.
- Added provenance requirements for failed edit recovery so verification notes cannot mark an issue fixed before the final candidate actually reflects the fix.
- Corrected MiniMax model preference casing to match Pi's exposed model IDs.

### Performance

- Resolved preview/runtime executables in parallel before launching Pi, reducing synchronous startup work while preserving Windows, macOS, and Linux fallback behavior.

### Fork Review

- Scanned all public forks and selectively adopted the low-risk startup/model-test improvements. Rejected product-specific or bloated fork changes such as Claude CLI bypass mode, ValiChord, Overleaf export, and an external `parallel-cli` dependency.

### Validation

- Full local tests passed: 121/121.
- Typecheck, build, local CLI doctor, and real one-shot launch smoke test passed.
- Fork scan compared 676 accessible forks: 666 behind, 2 identical, 8 with unique commits inspected.

## v0.2.36 - 2026-04-18

### Fixes

- Hardened `/review` so it writes a durable plan, evidence notes, and `outputs/<slug>-review.md` instead of stopping after a planning/narration response.
- Added blocked-review fallback behavior for PDFs or external sources that cannot be parsed, so failed extraction still produces an explicit review artifact with `Verification: BLOCKED`.
- Fixed subagent child-process spawning under Feynman's Pi wrapper so writer/reviewer subagents no longer treat `--mode` as a module path.
- Made optional package presets platform-aware so Linux users do not see or attempt to install the macOS-only `generative-ui` package.
- Added the Release Notes entry to the website docs sidebar.

### Documentation

- Updated research review docs to describe the concrete output files and blocked-extraction behavior.
- Updated package docs to clarify that memory and session search are core packages and `generative-ui` is macOS-only upstream.

### Validation

- Added regression coverage for the `/review` durable-artifact contract.
- Added regression coverage for platform-aware optional presets and Feynman-aware subagent spawning.
- Real installed-global review, package-list/install, subagent, and extension-load checks were run before release.

## v0.2.35 - 2026-04-18

### Fixes

- Restored the `/deepresearch` confirmation gate: the workflow now writes `outputs/.plans/<slug>.md`, summarizes the plan, and waits for explicit user approval before searching, drafting, citing, or delivering final artifacts.
- Changed top-level workflow invocation so `feynman deepresearch ...` behaves like the REPL workflow in a real terminal instead of forcing one-shot execution.
- Added a Feynman wrapper around Pi's CLI entrypoint so completed print-mode runs exit cleanly after Pi finishes.
- Tightened direct-mode `/deepresearch` artifact paths so research notes and verification files are written under `outputs/.drafts/`.

### Features

- Added section-focused `alpha_get_paper` extraction with `section` / `sections` filters for abstract, introduction, methodology, experiments, results, discussion, limitations, and conclusion.
- Added configurable `/summarize` context-window controls via flags and `FEYNMAN_SUMMARIZE_*` environment variables.

### Documentation

- Added public `RELEASES.md` and website release notes so each release has visible fix and feature history.
- Updated deep research docs to describe the plan-confirmation workflow and current PDF-safety behavior.

### Validation

- Real installed-global REPL test: typed `/deepresearch what is BM25`, verified that only the plan existed before approval, then replied `yes` and verified final report, provenance, draft, cited draft, research notes, and verification artifacts.
- Full local tests passed: 117/117.
- Typecheck, build, website build, local pack, and local global install checks passed.

## v0.2.34 - 2026-04-18

### Fixes

- Tightened `/deepresearch` so direct-mode research must use at least three distinct search terms or angles before drafting.
- Required direct-mode `/deepresearch` to record the exact search terms in the direct research artifact.
- Added regression coverage for the multi-query deep research contract.

### Validation

- Real RPC smoke test for `/deepresearch what is BM25` completed and wrote the required plan, draft, cited draft, final report, and provenance artifacts.
- Release CI published npm and native bundles for macOS arm64/x64, Linux x64, and Windows x64.

## v0.2.33 - 2026-04-18

### Fixes

- Rewrote `/deepresearch` from a long protocol-style prompt into a shorter execution checklist so local models are less likely to echo instructions instead of doing work.
- Made narrow direct-mode research complete without spawning verifier or reviewer subagents.
- Avoided the crash-prone PDF parser path in `/deepresearch` unless PDF extraction is explicitly requested.

### Validation

- Real RPC `/deepresearch what is BM25` completed with required artifacts and `agent_end`.
- Full local tests, typecheck, build, audits, website build, and pack dry-run passed before release.

## v0.2.32 - 2026-04-18

### Fixes

- Fixed Pi subagent parallel output propagation so top-level task `output` paths are honored.
- Added foreground and async regression coverage for subagent output handoff behavior.
- Hardened deep research prompts around durable artifacts and provenance.

## v0.2.31 - 2026-04-17

### Fixes

- Fixed Feynman runtime auth environment propagation so launched Pi sessions can see the expected model provider credentials.
- Revalidated setup and runtime startup paths after the auth fix.

## v0.2.30 - 2026-04-17

### Fixes

- Fixed Pi subagent task output handling in the runtime patch layer.
- Preserved bundled research-agent file handoffs for multi-agent workflows.

## v0.2.29 - 2026-04-17

### Maintenance

- Updated bundled Pi runtime packages.
- Rebuilt native release artifacts against the refreshed runtime package set.

## v0.2.28 - 2026-04-17

### Maintenance

- Removed runtime hygiene extension bloat and kept the bundled runtime closer to upstream Pi behavior.
- Reduced custom extension surface area to keep the research agent simpler.

## v0.2.27 - 2026-04-17

### Fixes

- Added Pi event guards for workflow state transitions.
- Improved workflow state tracking around long-running research operations.

## v0.2.26 - 2026-04-17

### Fixes

- Switched research context hygiene onto Pi runtime hooks instead of extra custom runtime logic.
- Improved compatibility with upstream Pi runtime behavior.

## v0.2.25 - 2026-04-17
